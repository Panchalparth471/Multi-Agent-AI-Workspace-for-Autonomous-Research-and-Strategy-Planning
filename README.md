#  Multi-Agent AI Workspace for Autonomous Research and Strategy Planning

A **modular, production-ready AI workspace** that leverages multiple autonomous agents to collaboratively perform end-to-end **research**, **analysis**, and **strategic decision-making**.

## Techstack
```
Groq, langchain, faiss, react, typescript, tailwindcss, mongodb, flask, Cohere
```
---

##  Key Features

###  Multi-Agent Architecture
- Built using **LangChain** with specialized agents for:
  - Research
  - Analysis
  - Planning
  - Writing
  - Validation  
- Each agent operates with **isolated tools and scoped memory** for modularity and task-specific focus.

###  RAG Pipeline (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
- **Cohere Embeddings**: Semantic vector representations for contextual understanding.
- **FAISS**: High-speed vector indexing and similarity search.
- **MongoDB**: Document storage with metadata and persistent context.

###  LLM Power
- Utilizes **LLaMA 3 via Groq API** for ultra-low latency and high-throughput generation.

###  Real-Time Web Search
- Integrated **SERP API** tool to retrieve and ground data from the open web dynamically.

###  Collaborative Chains
- Agents work together in structured pipelines:
  -  **SWOT Chain**: Extracts Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats from input.
  -  **Timeline Chain**: Builds chronological event breakdowns and plans.
  -  **Report Chain**: Compiles structured insights into formal reports.

##  Use Cases
-  Market Research & Competitive Intelligence  
-  Strategic Planning & Opportunity Analysis  
-  Automated Technical or Executive Reporting  
-  Knowledge Base Augmentation

##  Pipeline Performance Optimization Guide

### Pipeline Modes

1. **EXPRESS PIPELINE (5â€“15 seconds)**
   -  Use for: Quick insights, prototyping, real-time responses
   -  Trade-offs: Basic research + analysis only  
   -  Code: `run_express_pipeline(query)`

2. **BALANCED PIPELINE (15â€“30 seconds)**  
   -  Use for: Most production scenarios  
   -  Trade-offs: Skips validation and chains but includes core content  
   -  Code: `run_balanced_pipeline(query)`

3. **OPTIMIZED COMPREHENSIVE (30â€“60 seconds)**
   -  Use for: Full-featured analysis with parallel processing  
   -  Trade-offs: All features with performance optimizations  
   -  Code: `run_optimized_pipeline(query)`

4. **QUALITY FOCUSED (60â€“120 seconds)**
   -  Use for: High-quality reports, detailed analysis  
   -  Trade-offs: Slower but highest quality output  
   -  Code: `run_optimized_pipeline(query, config=PERFORMANCE_CONFIGS['quality_focused'])`

### Optimization Techniques

1. **Caching**
   - Agent instances cached to avoid recreation
   - Chain instances cached
   -  Memory usage: ~50MB per cached instance

2. **Parallel Processing**
   - Final steps (validation, report, SWOT, timeline) run in parallel
   - 4Ã— speedup using `ThreadPoolExecutor`

3. **Timeouts**
   - Prevents hanging on slow API calls
   - Configurable per step
   - Automatic fallback responses

4. **Content Limiting**
   - Input size limits prevent token overflow
   - Smart truncation preserves key information
   - Reduces API costs and latency

5. **Background Operations**
   - Indexing runs in background
   - Document saving is async
   - Non-blocking behavior

6. **Feature Toggling**
   - Skips expensive steps when not needed
   - Configurable depth per pipeline type
   - Optimized for specific use cases

### Performance Comparison

| Pipeline Type        | Time Estimate     | Speedup         |
|----------------------|------------------|-----------------|
| Original             | 120â€“180 seconds  | â€”               |
| Express              | 5â€“15 seconds     | 12Ã— faster      |
| Balanced             | 15â€“30 seconds    | 4â€“6Ã— faster     |
| Optimized            | 30â€“60 seconds    | 2â€“3Ã— faster     |

### Memory Usage

| Mode               | Memory Usage       |
|--------------------|--------------------|
| Without Caching    | ~200MB per run     |
| With Caching       | ~100MB per run     |
| Express Mode       | ~50MB per run      |

### API Calls Reduction

| Pipeline           | API Calls          |
|--------------------|--------------------|
| Original           | 8â€“12               |
| Express            | 2                  |
| Balanced           | 4                  |
| Optimized          | 8 (parallelized)   |
