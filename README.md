#  Multi-Agent AI Workspace for Autonomous Research and Strategy Planning

A **modular, production-ready AI workspace** that leverages multiple autonomous agents to collaboratively perform end-to-end **research**, **analysis**, and **strategic decision-making**.

---

##  Key Features

###  Multi-Agent Architecture
- Built using **LangChain** with specialized agents for:
  - Research
  - Analysis
  - Planning
  - Writing
  - Validation  
- Each agent operates with **isolated tools and scoped memory** for modularity and task-specific focus.

###  RAG Pipeline (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
- **Cohere Embeddings**: Semantic vector representations for contextual understanding.
- **FAISS**: High-speed vector indexing and similarity search.
- **MongoDB**: Document storage with metadata and persistent context.

###  LLM Power
- Utilizes **LLaMA 3 via Groq API** for ultra-low latency and high-throughput generation.

###  Real-Time Web Search
- Integrated **SERP API** tool to retrieve and ground data from the open web dynamically.

###  Collaborative Chains
- Agents work together in structured pipelines:
  -  **SWOT Chain**: Extracts Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats from input.
  -  **Timeline Chain**: Builds chronological event breakdowns and plans.
  -  **Report Chain**: Compiles structured insights into formal reports.
